# Placekitten jQuery Plugin

[Placekitten](http://placekitten.com) is a quick and simple service for getting pictures of kittens for use as placeholders in your designs or code.

This highly useful, long-sought-after plugin allows you to dynamically change any or all of your images to placeholder kittens with just a single line of jQuery magic.

# Detailed example:

    $('body').placekitten();

# Bookmarklet

A useful Placekitten bookmarklet is now available.  This is useful for running on sites like CNN.com to cheer up an otherwise depressing day of news.

As Github does not appear to allow Javascript links in README files, please visit [this link](http://lsemel.github.com/jquery-placekitten/bookmarklet.html) to get it.

Please note that this bookmarklet is highly experimental and should not be used as part of production code.
